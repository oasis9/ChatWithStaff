Ignore a player in staff chat.
- Probably not a good idea; all staff should be able to communicate to each other.

Staff chat mailing system.
- Good idea.

Talk directly to one staff member (1v1 staff chat channel).
- Borderline; Essentials/any-other-messaging-plugin can handle one-on-one conversations.

Multiple staff chat channels.
- Good idea, but it could run into issues with ChatWithStaff's name. People could make a channel for donors, builders, or 
   whatever, while ChatWithStaff's pure purpose is to communicate with staff. Unless ChatWithStaff's name changes, I'm
   undecided whether or not I will go through with this idea.
